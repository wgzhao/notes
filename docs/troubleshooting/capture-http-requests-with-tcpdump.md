# TCPDump Capture HTTP GET/POST requests

[Source](https://www.middlewareinventory.com/blog/tcpdump-capture-http-get-post-requests-apache-weblogic-websphere/ "Permalink to TCPDump Capture HTTP GET/POST requests | Devops Junction")

TCPDUMP is a [swiss army knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife) for all the administrators and developers when it comes to troubleshooting. This post is written for the people who work in middleware technologies. Web servers such as Apache, NGINX, Oracle HTTP, IHS web servers and application servers such as Weblogic, Websphere, Tomcat, Jboss

Consider yourself in any of the following scenarios

1. You want to monitor the **traffic inflow and outflow** of Apache httpd server on any specific port like port 80 or 443
2. You have to **track the HTTP calls between web and application servers** (or) to make sure that proxy is working fine.
3. When you want to examine the presence and values of specific headers like 

      ```
    X-Forwarded-For
    X-Forwarded-Proto
    X-Forwarded-Port
    X-Forwarded-Host
    X-Frame-Options
    X-Forwarded-By
    ETag
    ```
4. When you want to review the **Cookies** being placed in the request and response
5. when you want to review the data which is being posted to the server in the POST method like 

      ```
    Content-type: multipart/form-data;  
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
    Content-Type: application/json 
    Content-Type: text/plain
    ```
6. To track the incoming web service call, made using SOAP UI (or) any web service client.



## So, How do you do that?

**The answer is TCPDUMP. ** TCPDUMP is mostly misconceived as a network engineer's subject and it displays some incomprehensible binary data that none of us could understand.

With proper tools and little knowledge about protocols, anyone can easily make use of it and feel the magic lies within.

> Be informed that the industry standards have changed for good and the **HTTPS is becoming a basic requirement** for all webservices and websites. So it might make your troubleshooting little hard, since the packets are encrypted. **There is a solution to decrypt HTTPS traffic**
> 
> Refer my another article on [How to decrypt HTTPS traffic to see headers and request/response content](https://www.middlewareinventory.com/blog/how-to-decrypt-https-traffic/)

## The Objective

In this post, we are going to see how middleware administrators (or) developers could use tcpdump to accomplish their troubleshooting drama.

We are going to discuss the following items , practically as much as possible.

* How to monitor/track HTTP and HTTPS calls with tcpdump in weblogic,WebSphere,tomcat application servers and web servers like Apache **which runs on LINUX platform**
* How to tamper and read the incoming and outgoing HTTP traffic to our applications deployed in weblogic
* How to dig into the incoming (or) outgoing HTTP traffic and take a look at the concrete elements of HTTP protocol such as** headers, cookies, request body** as they gets transmitted.
* How to intercept the HTTP traffic initiated from the browser (or) SOAP UI to application server and sneak a peek into the content like **Request Body** like** XML,JSON **and **Username** and **Password** etc.
* How to monitor the incoming SOAP web service request body (or) request XML

* More practical examples on how to use TCPDUMP to analyze the HTTP traffic

## Before we proceed

Some basics about how to run tcpdump in your server in the right way.

**Make sure tcpdump is installed and configured properly**

    [root@mwiws01 ~]# tcpdump â€“ version
    tcpdump version 4.9.2
    libpcap version 1.5.3
    OpenSSL 1.0.2k-fips 26 Jan 2017

**Use the right interface name (or) use any in the interface name.**

To Get the interface name of your IP which you need to specify it in the tcpdump command. you can execut the command `ifconfig` (or) `ip a`

In my case, My web server IP is `192.168.31.76` so I should pick and use the interface name of the same `wlp0s20f3`

```shell
$ ifconfig wlp0s20f3
wlp0s20f3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.31.76  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.31.255
        inet6 2409:8a50:693:930:da38:cc7c:4d8f:8d93  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 2409:8a50:693:930::d02  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 fe80::cbf:9e72:4be8:6b73  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        inet6 2409:8a50:693:930:72db:3ee4:8539:332d  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        ether 6c:94:66:4b:c3:cd  txqueuelen 1000  
        RX packets 18758580  bytes 3461986404 (3.4 GB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 2564530  bytes 960162238 (960.1 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

Once you found your interface. In the requests you are going to track. you must mention the interface name

    tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3

you can optionally monitor all the available interfaces by mentioning

    tcpdump -i any

Now we are All ready to Play.

## tcpdump Examples

TCPDUMP does the same job irrespective to what technology (or) server you are using it for. In other words, if you would like capture HTTP calls for Apache. You mostly going to be using the port 80 or 443.

If you would like to capture the traffic of weblogic (or) Websphere or any application servers. All you have to do is change the port number in which your application server is listening

Though we have given examples for both web and application servers here. All you should be aware of is that. There is nothing specific to technology. We just change the port number (or) interface. That's all.

### How to capture All incoming HTTP GET traffic (or) requests

```shell
sudo tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -s 0 -A 'tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420'
```

**Explanation:-**

**`tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4]`** first determines the location of the bytes we are interested in (after the TCP header) and then selects the 4 bytes we wish to match against.

To know more about how this segment syntax has been derived. refer this [link](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/121011/wireshark-tcp-filter-tcptcp121-0xf0-24)

> Here `0x47455420` depicts the ASCII value of characters `'G' 'E' 'T' ' '`

| Character | ASCII Value |
| --------- | ----------- |
| G         | 47          |
| E         | 45          |
| T         | 54          |
| Space     | 20          |

### How to capture a Complete HTTP Transmission incoming and outgoing GET and POST

Let's suppose I access a page hosted in `192.168.31.76` web server from my base machine with ip address `192.168.31.205.` using both GET and POST methods. How do we track the HTTP request and response between the server and the client

```shell
tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -s 0 -A 'tcp dst port 80 and tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x504F5354 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x48545450 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x3C21444F and host 192.168.31.205'
```

Here additionally, we are using two more ASCII values to capture the outgoing HTML files and HTTP calls they are as follows.

`0x3C21444F` represents the ASCII value of `'<' 'D' 'O' 'C'` this is to capture the outgoing HTML file

`0x48545450` represents the ASCII value of `'H' 'T' 'T' 'P'` this is to capture the outgoing HTTP traffic (HTTP response)

**Trying with GET**

```shell
tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -s 0 -A 'tcp dst port 80 and tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x504F5354 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x48545450 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x3C21444F and host 192.168.31.205'

In the preceding illustrations, you can see the output of tcpdump command  shows the **REQUEST and RESPONSE** data along with the **HTML code**. 

### How to monitor all the incoming HTTP Request URL's (POST or GET)

```bash
tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -s 0 -v -n -l | egrep -i "POST /|GET /|Host:"
```

### How to capture HTTP Passwords in POST Requests

```bash
tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -s 0 -A -n -l | egrep -i "POST /|pwd=|passwd=|password=|Host:"
```

### How to capture the Cookies from Server and from Client ( Request & Response)

```bash
tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -nn -A -s0 -l | egrep -i 'Set-Cookie|Host:|Cookie:'
```

## How to Filter HTTP User Agents

Extract HTTP User Agent from HTTP request header.

```bash
tcpdump -vvAls0 | grep 'User-Agent:'
```

## How to capture the HTTP packets being transmitted between Webserver and Application server both GET & POST?

In cases, where you have check the HTTP traffic between webserver and application server. you can use tcpdump to diagnose and troubleshoot the issue. It will be helpful for many middleware administrators.

Let's suppose this is your environment

| Backend Server IP | 192.168.31.76  |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Nginx Server IP   | 192.168.31.205 |
| Nginx Server Port | 8080           |

You can run the following command at the application server to accomplish your requirement

```bash
tcpdump -i any -s 0 -A 'tcp dst port 8080 and tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x504F5354 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x48545450 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x3C21444F and host 192.168.31.76'
```

### How to capture a Complete HTTP Transmission with TCPDUMP ( GET & POST) on specific port

All the examples we have given above can be used for weblogic with just a little change in port number. However. we are giving an example here.

Here we are going to make a call from the client with up `192.168.31.205` to our  Application using GET and POST methods and capture the HTTP traffic data at the server end

```bash
tcpdump -i wlp0s20f3 -s 0 -A 'tcp dst port 18001 and tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x47455420 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x504F5354 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x48545450 or tcp[((tcp[12:1] & 0xf0) >> 2):4] = 0x3C21444F and host 192.168.31.76'
```

Sample Output

**Request from **`192.168.31.205` **using **`curl -v`

```bash
 curl -v -XPOST -d "hello"  http://localhost:8080/server
 Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.

### How to record a TCPDUMP Session (or) Capture packets with tcpdump

To record the tcpdump session, you can use the following command

**Note:** here I have used any as an interface to capture all the packets across all the channels/interfaces available in my server

```bash
tcpdump -i any -s 0 -X -w /tmp/tcpdump.pcap
```

`pcap` is a widely accepted extension for the tcpdump output.

### How to read the TCPDUMP recorded session (or) packet capture - pcap file

```bash
tcpdump -A -r /tmp/tcpdump.pcap
```

This way. you would be able to read the recorded session and it will offer more information than the ASCII matching commands.

You can also use commands like `less` for better readability and search.

```bash
tcpdump -A -r /tmp/tcpdump.pcap|less
```
